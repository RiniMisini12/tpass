## TPASS - Terminal Password Manager / Generator

This project helps me with a little pet peeve of mine, switching tabs to get a password whether it is to the browser, or whatever dark corner of my filesystem I happen to store it. It also doubles as a password generator (Highly doubt i or anyone will use this but hey cool to have it there).

### Cross compilation?

No, but anyone is welcome to fork it and make it work for himself.
